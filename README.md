# TaskScheduler
A resource allocation/optimization framework used to efficiently schedule tasks based on resource constraints.

# The Technical Problem of Task Scheduling and Optimization
Task scheduling and optimization involve allocating resources (e.g., time, machines, workers) to complete a set of tasks efficiently while satisfying constraints. The goal is often to minimize costs, time, or energy or maximize throughput, utilization, or other objectives.

## Challenges include:

Constraints: Tasks may have dependencies (e.g., Task B can only start after Task A is completed), limited resources, or deadlines. \
Optimization Objective: Goals such as minimizing the total completion time (makespan), waiting time, or maximizing throughput. \
Complexity: These problems are often NP-hard, meaning they cannot be solved efficiently for large instances.

## Example Problems
Job Shop Scheduling: Assigning jobs to machines with specific time requirements and precedence constraints.
Project Scheduling: Managing tasks with dependencies to meet deadlines.
Task Assignment: Allocating workers to tasks to minimize total cost or maximize productivity.
